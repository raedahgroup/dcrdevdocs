**Tokens**

Application in mind in which fans of x project could interact with the development by voting with tokens.

re smart contracts, Id look in the direction of building offchain application specific smart contracts using politeia, and possibly integrating some concepts from SLP.  https://github.com/simpleledger/slp-specifications/blob/master/slp-token-type-1.md


**Staking the Treasury**

Beyond the technical challenges of allowing the treasury to be staked while remaining under control of the stakeholders, which is substantial, it would immediately beg the question "how should it vote?"

**Split Tickets**

There is substantial opportunity cost to offer ifinitely scalable ticket splitting.

Split ticket participation count (determined from the blockchain), ~100 tickets concurrent is the max. Very low usage.

Solution being worked on: https://blog.decred.org/2019/11/11/LN-Multi-Owner-Tickets/

Demo showing offline LN payments, from inside decrediton, by building and using the MRTTREE construct: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1sQGHUKU7I

(MRTREE is the first construct needed for second-layer enabled, multi-owner tickets)
